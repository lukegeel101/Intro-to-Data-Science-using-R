"There is a cluster around (0,0) which is equivalent to no departure delay and no arrival delay. To fix this over cluster I will change the transparency of all points to make it easier to see overplotted clusters."

"Using the histograms for each month, it's easy to compare distributions. For all months, the temperature is normally distributed, the only real difference is the mean. For months 1,2, and 12, the mean was about 30 degrees. For 3,4, and 5 it was closer to 50. For months 6-10, the mean was closer to 70."
